None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Open for next milestone:**
- Vercel deployment pending user action (connect dashboard + set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var)
- Generic critiques risk — prompt engineering should be tested with 10+ real designs per industry
- Vercel free tier has 10s function timeout — may need Pro tier for complex images

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Next.js + Tailwind + ShadCN stack chosen for fast delivery with polished components
- Claude Sonnet for vision API (best vision model for the price)
- No database for V1 (stateless architecture to ship fast)
- Industry-specific context injection is the core product moat (not just generic feedback)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Research findings flagged:**
- Generic critiques are the #1 risk — prompt engineering must be tested with 10+ real designs per industry
- Vercel free tier has 10s function timeout — optimize prompt length and image size or plan for Pro tier
- Image compression client-side is critical for speed and cost

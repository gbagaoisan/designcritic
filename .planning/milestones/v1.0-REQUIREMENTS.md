## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User accounts / sign-up | Zero friction for V1 — validate demand first |
| Database / saved history | Stateless V1 avoids privacy and storage complexity |
| Payments / Stripe | Free to validate, monetize after traction (100+ users) |
| Figma plugin | Separate development track, screenshots work fine for V1 |
| Team features / collaboration | Single player only for V1 |
| Native mobile app | Responsive web only, designers are on desktop |
| Real-time streaming responses | Adds complexity, full response is only 5-10s |
| AI-generated visual fix suggestions | Image generation unreliable for UI mockups |
| Design scoring / grading | Numbers feel arbitrary, qualitative feedback is more actionable |
